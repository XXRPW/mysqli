Nowadays, we use Relational Database Management System(RDMS) to control huge volumes of datas.

RDMS allows you to
>Enables you to implement a database with tables, columns and indexes.

>Guarantees the Referential Integrity between rows of various tables.

>Updates the indexes automatically.

>Interprets an SQL query and combines information from various tables.

***few definitions to know before the tutorial actually starts***

Database : A database is a collection of tables, with related data.
Table − A table is a matrix with data. A table in a database looks like a simple spreadsheet.
Column − One column contains data of one and the same kind, for example the column postcode.
Row − A row (= tuple, entry or record) is a group of related data, for example the data of one subscription.
Redundancy − Storing data twice, redundantly to make the system faster.
Primary Key − A primary key is unique. A key value can not occur twice in one table. With a key, you can only find one row.
Foreign Key − A foreign key is the linking pin between two tables.
Compound Key − A compound key (composite key) is a key that consists of multiple columns, because one column is not sufficiently unique.
Index − An index in a database resembles an index at the back of a book.
Referential Integrity − Referential Integrity makes sure that a foreign key value always points to an existing row.

It's fine if you don't understand all of these definitions because when we work on rows and columns on mysql it will make all sense.


I recommend studying php and html before this tutorial
at 11/18/2019 I haven't started on these two tutorials but in the future I will
I will not explain how to install mysql.

***PHP syntax***
Even though PHP can be used with different languagese like PERL, C, C++, JAVA, PHP is one of the most popular language to be used with mysql.(and people usually hate PHP and say that it's the same as contry musics because it's bad and it's everywhere)
